## How to Get Your Telegram Group or Channel ID

To use **TGYT-WatchBot**â€™s group features, youâ€™ll need your group or channelâ€™s numeric ID. The easiest way is with [@getmyid_bot](https://t.me/getmyid_bot):

1. **Add @getmyid_bot to your group or channel.**
2. **Send any message** in your group/channel, or mention the bot.
3. The bot will reply with:
   - Your **User ID**
   - The **Current Chat ID** (this is the group or channel ID)

> **Note:**  
> - Group and Channel IDs are usually negative numbers, e.g. `-1001234567890`.
> - Only admins can add bots to private groups/channels.

**Example Output:**
- Your user ID: 62155370
- Current chat ID: -4901111704

## Add a Custom Group to TGYT-WatchBot

Once you have your group ID, use the following command to add a group to the bot:
- /addgroup [GROUPNAME] [-CHATID]

Where:
- `ENG` is your custom group name (you can choose any name you like)
- `-4901111704` is your group/chat or channelâ€™s numeric ID

Thatâ€™s it! Your group is now linked to **TGYT-WatchBot**.
